####Parent Styles Associated With Children's Self-Regulation and Competence in School
•	Wendy S. Grolnick, New York University
•	 Richard M. Ryan, University of Rochester
The purpose of this study was to further explicate the nature of parental influences on children's school-related adjustment and performance. Specifically, they investigated how relevant parent practices are associated not only with achievement per se, but also with the development of attitudes, motives, and self-evaluative outcomes that facilitate negotiation of the social and cognitive demands of school. One dimension that has been linked to school performance outcomes (Hess & Holloway, 1985) and that appeared to be particularly relevant to the development of self-regulation is that of parental control. Described by such terms as "restrictive" (Becker, 1964), "controlling" (Schaefer, 1959), and "autocratic" (Baldwin, 1949), this extreme pole of the control dimensions is characterized by the parent's use of power in achieving compliance as well as a paramount valuing of obedience in children.
